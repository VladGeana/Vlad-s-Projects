    "Most documents only contain a small subset of the vocabulary, resulting in a very sparse data matrix.\n",
    "To take advantage of the sparsity, in this exercise `data` is represented as a `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`, which can store sparse matrices efficiently while still allowing efficient row-based indexing.\n",
