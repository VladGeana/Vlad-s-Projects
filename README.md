# Algorithms - C++
Some of the most relevant algorithms I have implemented during highschool, after reading online articles about each of them beforehand.
# Data Structures - C++ 
Binary Indexed Trees, RMQ - sparse table, Segment Trees and more..
# Notional Lottery Simulation - Java
This was part of a 2-week coursework at university. The purpose was to apply knowledge studied beforehand related to Java class inheritance.
# Piano Hero Project - C#
This project was the first one I implemented in C#, in the third year of high school, and it follows the idea behind the well known 'Guitar Hero' console game, with the difference that it uses a piano instead. I tried to implement a functional piano, in the sense that the tiles produce sounds for as long as they are pushed, and any number of tiles can be pushed at once, such that users can perform chord progressions and right hand leads simultaneously. The way the game works is that a sequence of piano notes is recorded form the keyboard, followed by an attempt to reproduce them adequately by another user. The better the timing, the greater the score, as expected :-) .
# Snake Game - Java
Another 2-week coursework for university that tested our coding skills: Java class inheritance, GUIs, simple data structures(vectors and matrices), code clarity and comments.
# StopClock - Java
Timing device implemented in Java with a graphical user interface.
# Uuencode - Java
Program to encode binary data for transmission in email systems.
